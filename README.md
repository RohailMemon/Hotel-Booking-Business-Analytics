**Hotel Booking Business Analytics**

**Introduction**

This project focuses on Hotel Booking Business Analytics. We analyze booking trends, revenue performance, cancellations, and customer segmentation to inform data-driven decision-making. By leveraging data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory analysis, we provide actionable insights that can help hotels optimize pricing strategies, improve customer retention, and maximize profitability.
Through this analysis, we address four key areas:

1. Booking Trends Analysis – Identifying peak demand periods and seasonality.
2. Revenue Insights – Understanding ADR (Average Daily Rate) trends and total revenue drivers.
3. Cancellation Analysis – Examining factors contributing to lost bookings.
4. Customer Segmentation – Analyzing guest behavior to improve marketing strategies.

Our goal is to transform raw hotel booking data into meaningful insights that enable businesses to make strategic growth and operational efficiency decisions.

**Business Analytics Breakdown**


**1️⃣ Booking Trends Analysis – Optimize Pricing & Demand Forecasting**

**1. Peak Booking Months:** The most bookings occur in July & August, indicating high seasonal demand.

**2. Off-Peak Months:** Bookings drop significantly in November & January, suggesting opportunities for discounts and promotions.

**3. Actionable Strategy:**

•	Increase pricing during peak months to maximize revenue.

•	Offer discounts & marketing campaigns for off-peak months to boost occupancy.


**2️⃣ Revenue Insights – Increase Profitability & Adjust Pricing**

**1. ADR (Average Daily Rate) is highest in August**, meaning hotels can leverage peak demand for premium pricing.

**2. City Hotels have higher ADR than Resort Hotels**, possibly due to more business travelers.

**3. Direct bookings generate higher revenue** compared to Online Travel Agencies (OTAs).

**4. Actionable Strategy:**

•	Dynamic pricing model: Increase ADR when demand is high.

•	Promote direct bookings to reduce OTA commission costs.


**3️⃣ Cancellation Analysis – Reduce Lost Revenue**

**1. Cancellations are highest for Online Travel Agencies (OTA) customers**, while direct bookings have lower cancellation rates.

**2. Longer lead times increase the risk of cancellation**, meaning guests who book far in advance tend to cancel more.

**3. Actionable Strategy:**

•	Require higher deposit or cancellation fees for OTA bookings.

•	Flexible rescheduling policies for long lead-time bookings to retain customers instead of losing them.

**4️⃣ Customer Segmentation – Targeted Marketing & Retention**

**1. Business travelers (weekday stays) book City Hotels more often**, while leisure travelers (weekend stays) prefer Resort Hotels.

**2. Guests who stay longer contribute more revenue**, meaning loyalty programs can be beneficial.

**3. Actionable Strategy:**

•	Personalized promotions: Offer discounts for weekend stays at City Hotels and weekday stays at Resort Hotels.

•	Loyalty rewards for long-staying guests to encourage repeat visits.
